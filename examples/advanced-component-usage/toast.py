"""
This app demonstrates how you can display dismissable messages to the user
using the Toast component.

The key idea is to maintain a list of the messages in memory on the client side
using dash_core_components.Store. Each time the Store is updated, a callback
renders all of the messages that are in the Store.

The displayed messages can then be controlled by controlling what is in the
Store. In this example we use a pattern-matching callback that responds to both
the main button being clicked, but also any of the dismiss buttons of the Toast
components. With dash.callback_context we can determine what was pressed, and
add or remove a message from the Store accordingly. Using this same pattern you
can add or remove messages from the message store in response to all kinds of
different events.
